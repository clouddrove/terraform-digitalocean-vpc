    Terraform DigitalOcean VPC

<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 
    VPCs are virtual networks containing resources that can communicate with each other in full isolation, using private IP addresses.

We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-digitalocean-vpc/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
      module "vpc" {
      source            = "clouddrove/vpc/digitalocean"
      version           = "0.13.0"
      name              = "vpc"
      application       = "clouddrove"
      environment       = "test"
      label_order       = ["environment", "application", "name"]
      enable_vpc        = true
      region            = "bangalore-1"
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| description | A free-form text field up to a limit of 255 characters to describe the VPC. | `string` | `"VPC"` | no |
| enable\_vpc | A boolean flag to enable/disable vpc. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| ip\_range | The range of IP addresses for the VPC in CIDR notation. Network ranges cannot overlap with other networks in the same account and must be in range of private addresses as defined in RFC1918. It may not be larger than /16 or smaller than /24. | `string` | `"10.10.0.0/16"` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list` | `[]` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| region | The region to create VPC, like `london-1` , `bangalore-1` ,`newyork-3` `toronto-1`. | `string` | `"bangalore-1"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| created\_at | The date and time of when the VPC was created. |
| default | A boolean indicating whether or not the VPC is the default one for the region. |
| id | The unique identifier for the VPC.. |
| urn | The uniform resource name (URN) for the VPC. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
